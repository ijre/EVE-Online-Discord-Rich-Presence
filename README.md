# Hello, and welcome to my EVE Online Discord RPC repo!
This repo contains a program specifically for Discord and EVE Online, which will update your Rich Presence with your character name and location. Feel free to make any pull requests! If you have any issues, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/ijre/EVE-Online-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases/latest).

## To download:
1. Go to the [most recent release page](https://github.com/ijre/EVE-Online-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases/latest)
2. Download the "build.7z" file
3. Extract anywhere you want, as long as the two .dlls and the .exe are all in the same folder it'll work
4. Click "Browse"; if it didn't automatically go to "Documents\EVE\logs\Gamelogs", please locate the Gamelogs folder, then select the most recent file (when sorted by ascending name, it will be at the very bottom).
