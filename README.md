# Hello, and welcome to my EVE Online Discord Rich Presence repository; this is a work in progress so expect bugs and other shenanigans, README at the bottom.

* **Todo:**
  * **Add full\* support for other languages (requires translators)**
  * **Languages:**
     * **Russian**
     * **German**
     * **Japanese**

* **In progress:**
   * **Add non-English -> English support\*\***
   * **Languages:**  
    * **None currently in progress**

* **Done:**
    * **Languages:**
      * **French**
      * **English**

**\* Full is defined as both your actual Rich Presence and the values grabbed being of that language.**  

**\*\* There's a currently (0.1.0.0) non-functioning setting for those who want their Rich Presence in English but their game is not in English.**

2. Download the "Release.7z" file
3. Extract anywhere you want, as long as the two .dlls and the .exe are all in the same folder it'll work

5. **With the game already open and connected to a character**, click "Browse", goto your Gamelogs folder which should be located in Documents\EVE\logs\Gamelogs by default, and select the most recent file (when sorted by ascending name, it will be at the very bottom).
