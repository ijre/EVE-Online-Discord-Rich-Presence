# Hello, and welcome to my EVE Online Discord Rich Presence repository; this is a work in progress so expect bugs and other shenanigans, README at the bottom.
### If anyone could please supply me with an English gamelog, that would help tremendously, my game is bugged and won't let me change languages but I need to know if the English gamelog has different formatting; it would also help if people could bug test in other languages as well, though I doubt it will be necessary

* **Todo:**
  * **Add full\* English support (waiting on gamelog)**
  * **Add full\* support for other languages (requires translators)**

* **In progress:**
   * **Work out every current bug (0.1.0.0)**
   * **Add non-English -> English support\*\***

* **Done:**
  *  **Full\* French support**
  *  **Minor\*\*\* support for all languages**

**\* Full is defined as both your actual Rich Presence and the values grabbed being of that language.**  

**\*\* There's a currently (0.1.0.0) non-functioning setting for those who want their Rich Presence in English but their game is not in English.**  

**\*\*\* Minor is defined as the values grabbed being of that language.**

# README:

## As stated above, this is a WIP, expect possible bugs or crashes (not game crashes, dont worry)

### To download:
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ijre/EVE-Online-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases), and download the most recent version, or [click this link.](https://github.com/ijre/EVE-Online-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases/latest)
2. Download the "Release.7z" file
3. Extract anywhere you want, as long as the two .dlls and the .exe are all in the same folder it'll work
4. Currently, the only supported option is to tick the box of "Is your game in any language that isn't English?" then select "In-game".  
5. **With the game already open and connected to a character**, click "Browse", goto your Gamelogs folder which should be located in Documents\EVE\logs\Gamelogs by default, and select the most recent file (when sorted by ascending name, it will be at the very bottom).  

    If your game is not in English, it should work in theory though the text stating your location and name will be in French.
# IF YOUR GAME IS IN ENGLISH AND IT WORKS, **PLEASE** OPEN AN ISSUE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR DISCORD PROFILE SHOWING YOUR RICH PRESENCE, OTHERWISE IF IT DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE POST YOUR GAMELOG INSTEAD
